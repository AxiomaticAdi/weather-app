## Project Link
[Weather App Live Demo](https://axiomaticadi.github.io/weather-app/)

## Overview
This basic weather app provides real-time weather information. 

## Learnings
The purpose of this project was to implement learnings around modern JavaScript features, particularly:

- **API Interaction**: make network requests using the JavaScript `fetch` API to retrieve data from third-party weather services
- **RESTful Services**: Understand REST APIs and how to interact with them to perform CRUD operations
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Learn to handle asynchronous operations using Promises and `async/await` syntax
